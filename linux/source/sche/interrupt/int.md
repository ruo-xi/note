## types

Interrupts can be grouped into two categories based on the source of the interrupt:

- **synchronous**, generated by executing an instruction
- **asynchronous**, generated by an external event
- maskable
  - can be ignored
  - signalled via INT pin
- non-maskable
  - cannot be ignored
  - signalled via NMI pin

Synchronous interrupts, usually named exceptions, handle conditions detected by the processor itself in the course of executing an instruction. Divide by zero or a system call are examples of exceptions.

* exceptions
  * processor detected

    * **faults** 

      a type of exception that is reported **before** the execution of the instruction and **can be usually corrected**. The saved EIP is the address of the instruction that caused the fault, so after the fault is corrected the program can re-execute the faulty instruction.

    * **traps**

      a type of exception that is reported **after** the execution of the instruction in which the exception was detected. The saved EIP is the address of the instruction **after** the instuction that caused the trap

    * **aborts**

  * programmed

    * **int n**

Asynchronous interrupts, usually named interrupts, are external events generated by I/O devices. For example a network card generates an interrupts to signal that a packet has arrived.
